# sisbase Documentation

sisbase is a base for making discord bots. 

It makes the bot developer life easier by handling **all** the *boring parts*
(connection to discord, registry of commands, managing systems,creation and destruction of timers, etc...), so the
developer can focus on making what matters : **new features and commands** while leaving the crude work for sisbase to
handle.
