### What broke :
- `Nothing` This version is fully backwards compatible with 1.0.1

## sisbase `Hashima Chihiro` 1.2.0

+ Added `Custom Settings` to `Sisbase`

Ever wanted to add your own settings to the config.json file? Now you **can!**

Using the new Extesion Methods from `sisbase.Utils` you too can add anything onto the configuration file and request at will.

+ Added `RequireSystemAttribute`

IF you need that a system be active for a command to execute, you now can just add this simple attribute to it (providing the  `Type` of said system of course) and it
will only be executed **if** said system exists.

+ Simplified way to register a bot.

Now you need to register a bot with `#SisbaseBot.RegisterBot()` isntead of manually registering the commands and systems.

### What broke :

- If you used the token value anywhere in your bot (which of course you shouldn't do anyways), you now can't since that property is `internal`.
- Registering all systems from an assembly is now inaccessible since its `internal` , just replace it with the new unified way.
