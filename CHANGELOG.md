### What broke :
- `Nothing` This version is fully backwards compatible with 1.0.1

## sisbase `Hashima Chihiro` 1.2.0

+ Added `Custom Settings` to `Sisbase`

Ever wanted to add your own settings to the config.json file? Now you **can!**

Using the new Extesion Methods from `sisbase.Utils` you too can add anything onto the configuration file and request at will.

+ Added `RequireSystemAttribute`

IF you need that a system be active for a command to execute, you now can just add this simple attribute to it (providing the  `Type` of said system of course) and it
will only be executed **if** said system exists.

+ Simplified way to register a bot.

Now you need to register a bot with `#SisbaseBot.RegisterBot()` isntead of manually registering the commands and systems.

### What broke :

- If you used the token value anywhere in your bot (which of course you shouldn't do anyways), you now can't since that property is `internal`.
- Registering all systems from an assembly is now inaccessible since its `internal` , just replace it with the new unified way.

### Patch `1.2.1`
+ Fixes system registration in order to follow `RequireSystemAttribute` logic.
+ Adds more documentation

## sisbase `Chigusa Asuha` 1.3.0

+ Added `IScheduler`

If you need that a system executes something every other `X (hours/minutes/seconds)` you now can set an `Action` and a 
`TimeSpan` on your systems and let the SMC do the dirty job for you.

`IScheduler` is fully compatible with all available `ISystem` interfaces.

+ Added `disable` and `reload` commands for managing the systems insude Discord

+ + If your pre initialization checks `At Initialize() of course!` fails, you can now reload all the unregistered systems once the conditions could be met.

+ + + Eg : A system depends on a connection to a database, but such connection could not be made at run time since the database were offline.

To reload the systems, the `owner` of the bot's application must run `[prefix]system reload`.

+ + If you ever need to disable a system you also can do that.

To disable a system, the `owner` of the bot's application must run `[prefix]system disable` and follow the instructions sent to chat by the bot.

### What broke

TBA.
